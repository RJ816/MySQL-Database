  <div class="row p-0 m-0 mb-1">1st Normal Form</div>
  <div class="row mb-1"><img src="images/first.png" alt="fist order" class="small-table"></div>
  <div class="row mb-3">
    <p>
      Using the <a href="files/Bagel_Order_Form.docx" target="new_blank">Bagel Order Form Template</a>, 
      a 1st normal form was created for the relation (table) by grouping repeated attributes and maintaining single values in each cell.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row p-0 m-0 mb-1">2nd Normal Form</div>
  <div class="row mb-1"><img src="images/second.png" alt="second order" class="large-table"></div>
  <div class="row mb-3">
    <p>
      After 1NF was completed, 2NF was achieved by making sure all non-key attributes (columns) were functionally dependent on the entire primary key (PK). 
      Two new relations were created (Bagel Order Line Item and Bagel) with their respective non-key attributes to conform to 2NF standards. 
      The Bagel relation contains all attributes that strictly describe bagels and not the order ID, so were separated from the Bagel Order relation. 
      Bagel Quantity is the only attribute that is dependent on the entire composite primary key, so were separated in the Bagel Order Line Item relation. 
      The rest of the attributes are dependent on the Bagel Order ID only, so were left in the original Bagel Order relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cardinality between the Bagel Order entity and Bagel Order Line Item entity can be explained as one order can have many order line items, 
      while each order line item instance can be on only one order (1 to Many). 
      An Order Line Item can only have 1 type of bagel, while each bagel type can appear on multiple line items (Many to One).

  <div class="row mb-3">
    <p>
      Once 2NF is done, 3NF was performed to eliminate transitive dependencies (non-key attributes with dependencies on other non-key attributes). 
      A new attribute (Customer ID) was created as a foreign key in the renamed Bagel Order (Bagel Invoice) and used as a PK in Bagel Customer to tie all customer attributes to the new PK. 
    <p>
      Cardinality remained the same for the old relations, but for the new relations a bagel invoice can only have one customer, while a customer can have many invoices (many to one).

    <p>
      All attributes were renamed to conform to database naming conventions (no spaces) and data types were described for each attribute. 
      Some string (CHAR) and number (Numeric) data types were defined for attributes that are known to have a fixed length.
